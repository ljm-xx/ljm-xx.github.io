Today I've been working on a Fibonacci finder for one of the euler problems and it has been truly fascinating. 
I thought the process would be similar to my Prime Kata, and it is, but its different in ways that truly stump me. 
The necessity of lists is one thing that has been really fun to work out and just trying to build this tool on my own has been a great time. 
One thing that has not been so cool is my struggle to connect Github to Intellj after the new token update, Ill have to ask Gina tomorrow, But for now I'm sliding by just using the browser.
