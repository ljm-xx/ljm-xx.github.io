So the tictactoe exercise was brought up today. I'm supposed to figure out some ways to do it and right now my most acheivable plan is just to set up a series of "if's" for every possible move.
I also heard something about an algorithm and that piques my interest but im not sure what that is or how to use it so im looking forward to that.
