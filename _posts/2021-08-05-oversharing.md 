You might have noticed that my past few posts have been hitting the same points. 
This is bacause I am not too sure what to write, my learning has hit a roadblock. 
Truthfully I'm not sure what tone im supposed to use with this blog.
It's confusing because the readers are all members of the company yet the purpose of the blog is to catalog my musings.
I havent heard anything bad so far so I shouldn't be to wrong.
