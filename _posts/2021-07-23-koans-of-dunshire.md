I've been working on the koans for a while now and I still feel very lost, less lost than before but admittedly still confused.
I struggle with many of the more mathy portions of Clojure due to its strange structure and my unfamiliarity with coding as a whole. 
Thankfully I still enjoy learning this subject and I look forward to when I am capable of truly creating.
