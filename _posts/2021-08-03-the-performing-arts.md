Tomorrow I have to perform the prime factors kata to my mentor, in truth I really dont think that I know it well enough to do so. 
The process of learning code has been excruciatingly slow, but thats just because I dont feel like im grasping it.
There's not anything specific that keeps me hung up its just that in this subject im a very slow learner. 
Hopefuly I learn quick because I dont want to embarrass myself too much tomorrow.
