Much of the same for today. Fibonacci is still a tough nut to crack and bowling has always been an ironic "sport."
The "Fib-Finder" as I've come to call it has formulated itself as a "crawling list",
wherein the only two values are the ones relevent to the term/operation in the Fibonacci sequence and those not needed are dropped. 
I still am puzzled on how to implement it but further research and an honest coding session should quickly remedy that.
