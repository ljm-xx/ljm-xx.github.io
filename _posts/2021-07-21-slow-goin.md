"I swear I'm not slow just very tired" is what I said when I finished up my most recent meeting with my mentor. 
I think that it describes my current progress rather well.
To my novice mind Clojure requires you to read its information backwards and send it out inverse to that.
Now, I am *very* new to coding as a whole so it is very likely that I am complaining about a standard that I'll just get used to like everybody else.
But for now simply reading the code is a great hurdle.
