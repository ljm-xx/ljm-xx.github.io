Im trying desperatly to get both my kata and euler working correctly, but the more I try the more apparent my incompetence becomes.
I really have no direction when it comes to the euler thingy, maybe ill try and find someone doing them online and go from there. 
As for my kata I still get stuck on the most basic of errors, and thats truly disheartening.
