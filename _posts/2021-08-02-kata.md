This weekend I have been working on a prime factorization tool. 
Its goal is to find the prime factors of a given number.
On Saturday Gina went through the excersise with me; while doing this I understood the concept and the execution of the code.
However, once I tried it on my own it seemed like all that I had learned just flew out the window. 
I still dont fully understand some of the more basic concepts like loops or conds but i guess that'll only get better the more I use them. 
After todays meeting I feel like Im better suited to progress but I still struggle with the easy stuff.
