Oh "hardly workin" for sure. I havent beeen doing much regarding this apprenticeship recently. 
Having had a bad bout of sickness for the past two days compiled by the stress of preparing for life past highschool,
I really have not been very willing to work on much of anything. But now that the body is on the mend I do find myself far more curious obout the goings on behind the code rather than the code itself.
I'll have to look into that at somepoint.
